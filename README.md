"Hey team, I've removed the large data files from the Git repository to fix push/pull issues. 
You will now need to download the WorldPop and Esri .tif files manually and place them in a 
backend/data folder for the analysis script to work. 
I have pushed a .gitignore file to prevent them from being uploaded again."
